Brown 2021-05-02 Chapter 1 Preface 1.1 Who this book is for This book is written for a class that introduces students to both R and Python for analyzing and modeling data. This text does not describe statistical modeling techniques in detail (although many exercises will be motivated by different statistical techniques), but rather teaches the basics of data “cleaning,” “munging” and manipulation. 1.2 Why the side by side approach? The R versus Python holy war notwithstanding, I have been a part of several institutions that desire to teach their students both R and Python. This book serves this purpose. Also, I think teaching these two languages side by side helps reinforce shared and unshared concepts. 1.3 Conventions Sometimes R and Python code look very similar. Sometimes, they even look identical. This is why we usually separate R and Python code into separate sections. However, whenever it is necessary to prevent confusion, I will remind you what language is being used in comments (more about comments in section TODO). # in python print(&#39;hello world&#39;) ## hello world # in R print(&#39;hello world&#39;) ## [1] &quot;hello world&quot; 1.4 Installing the Required Software To get started, you must install both R and Python. The installation process depends on what kind of machine you have (e.g. what type of operating system your machine is running, is your processor \\(32\\) or \\(64\\) bit, etc.). I provide some helpful links below. However, there are many alternatives available to you for how to install, and different options may be preferable to different students. Moreover, these options are likely to change over time. If you prefer to take a different route, or you already have a solution to either of these, feel free to keep using it. The code should still work as long as you’re using relatively recent versions of each. For Python, you need a version that is &gt;=3.6, and for R, it nees to be &gt;=4.0.0. 1.4.1 Installing R (and RStudio) It is recommended that you install R and RStudio Desktop. RStudio Desktop is a graphical user interface with many tools that making writing R easier and more fun. Install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). You can access instructions for your specific machine by clicking here. You can get RStudio Desktop directly from the company’s website. 1.4.2 Installing Python by Installing Anaconda It is recommended that you install Anaconda, which is a package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution with many third party open source packages. It provides a graphical user interface for us, too, just as RStudio does. You can access instructions for your specific machine and OS by clicking here. 1.5 Automatic Grading If you are an instructor, you may contact TODO to receive files that allow you to implement programmatic grading for this course. R scripts are graded with the gradeR package, and Python scripts with the Otter Grader package (TODO cite). "]]
