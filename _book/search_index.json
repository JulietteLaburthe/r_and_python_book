You will notice that some of the exercise questions are unusually specific. For example, they will ask the student to assign the answer in a certain form to a variable with a very specific name. This is because they are written with automatic grading in mind. All of exercises have been very generously “battle tested” by the Fall 2021 STAT 5430 class at the University of Virginia. R scripts were graded with the gradeR package (Brown 2020), and Python scripts with the Otter-Grader library (Pyles 2019).
