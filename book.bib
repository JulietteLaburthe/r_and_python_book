edition = {1st},
abstract = {From the Author: Why Use R for Your Statistical Work? As the Cantonese say, yauh peng, yauh leng, which means both inexpensive and beautiful. Why use anything else? R has a number of virtues: It is a public-domain implementation of the widely regarded S statistical language, and the R/S platform is a de facto standard among professional statisticians. It is comparable, and often superior, in power to commercial products in most of the significant senses -- variety of operations available, programmability, graphics, and so on. It is available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. In addition to providing statistical operations, R is a general-purpose programming language, so you can use it to automate analyses and create new functions that extend the existing language features. R includes a library of several thousand user-contributed packages. It incorporates features found in object-oriented and functional programming languages. R is capable of producing beautiful graphics for your presentations, reports or articles. }

abstract = {This tutorial manual provides a comprehensive introduction to R, a software package for statistical computing and graphics. R supports a wide range of statistical techniques, and is easily extensible via user-defined functions written in its own language or using C, C++ or Fortran. One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced. This is a printed copy of the tutorial manual from the R distribution, with additional examples, notes and corrections. It is based on R version 2.9.0, released April 2009. R is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). It can be used with GNU/Linux, Unix and Microsoft Windows. All the money raised from the sale of this book supports the development of free software and documentation.}

edition = {1st},
abstract = {For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools. Working scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing different types of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models. Quite simply, this is the must-have reference for scientific computing in Python. With this handbook, youll learn how to use:IPython and Jupyter: provide computational environments for data scientists using PythonNumPy: includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in PythonPandas: features the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in PythonMatplotlib: includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in PythonScikit-Learn: for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms}
