# Input and Output

So far we have been created small pieces of data within our scripts. This is only for pedagogical purposes. In real life, we usually read in external data. External data can be in the form of a text file (e.g. `my_data.csv` or `stock_returns.txt`), it can be queried from a database. 

After we have created something useful, we might be interested in storing our results. We can write out to a data base, a text file, or we can save a digitized version of our work space.
