## R Part

All answers to questions related to R should be written in a file named `data_types_lab.R`. 
  
1. Answer the same question above, but use R types? Assign your answers to a `character vector` of length four called `questionOne`. 

    + An individual's IP address
    + whether or not an individual attended a study
    + the number of seeds found in a plant
    + the amount of time it takes for a car to race around a track
  
2. Floating points are weird. What gets printed is not the same as what is stored!

    + Assign `a` to `2/3`
    + `print` `a`, and copy/paste what you see into the variable `aPrint`
    + Take a look at the documentation for `options`. Assign the value of `options()$digits` to `numDigitsStart`
    + Change the number of digits to `22`
    + Again, `print`, `a` and copy/paste what you see into the variable `aPrintv2`
    + Assign the output of `options()$digits` to `numDigitsEnd`
    
3. Floating points are weird. What gets stored might not be what you want. ["The only numbers that can be represented exactly in Râ€™s numeric type are integers and fractions whose denominator is a power of 2."](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f) 

    + Assign the squre root of 2 to `mySqrt`
    + Print the square of this variable
    + Test (using `==`) that this variable is equal to `2`. Assign the result of this test to `isTwoRecoverable`
    + Test for near equality (using `all.equal`) that this variable is "equal" to `2`. Assign the result of this test to `closeEnough`. Make sure to read the documentation for this function because the return type can be tricky!


## Python Part

All answers to questions related to Python should be written in a file named `data_types_lab.py`.


1. Which Python type is ideal for each piece of data? Assign your answers to a `list` of `str`ings called `question_one`. 

    + An individual's IP address
    + whether or not an individual attended a study
    + the number of seeds found in a plant
    + the amount of time it takes for a car to race around a track

2. Floating points are weird. What gets printed is not the same as what is stored!

    + Assign `a` to `2/3`
    + `print` `a`, and copy/paste what you see into the variable `aPrint`
    + Take a look at the documentation for `options`. Assign the value of `options()$digits` to `numDigitsStart`
    + Change the number of digits to `22`
    + Again, `print`, `a` and copy/paste what you see into the variable `aPrintv2`
    + Assign the output of `options()$digits` to `numDigitsEnd`
    
3. Floating points are weird. What gets stored might not be what you want. The Python documentation has an excellent discussion of how storage behavior can be surprising. Click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) to read it.

    + Assign the squre root of 2 to `mySqrt`
    + Print the square of this variable
    + Test (using `==`) that this variable is equal to `2`. Assign the result of this test to `isTwoRecoverable`
    + Test for near equality (using `all.equal`) that this variable is "equal" to `2`. Assign the result of this test to `closeEnough`. Make sure to read the documentation for this function because the return type can be tricky!
