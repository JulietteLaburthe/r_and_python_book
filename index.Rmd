# Welcome {-}

## A Sample Course {-}

Please email me for access to a private Github repository. 

Assignments are written with automatic grading in mind. R scripts are graded with the `gradeR` package, and Python scripts with the `Otter Grader` package (TODO cite). If you want to generate your own autograding files, you may use the tool here (TODO).

## Become a Contributor {-}
