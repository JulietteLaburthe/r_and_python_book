# Welcome {-}

## A Sample Course {-}

Please email me for access to a private Github repository with course materials such as a syllabus, course schedule, and assignments.

Assignments are written with automatic grading in mind. R scripts are graded with the `gradeR` package [@gradeR], and Python scripts with the [`Otter-Grader` library](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [@otter]. The quickest way to create your own autograding bundles is to use the tool here (TODO).

## Become a Contributor {-}
